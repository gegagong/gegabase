			<div class="PostContent"> 
				<p>The ego is a structure in our brain that dictates what we do. Your ego is an ever expanding flowchart of sort that your mind uses to decide what you do. Before it decides on an action, your mind puts the thought through this flowchart to determine how it will react to it. For example, driving.</p>
				<p>If you've been driving on your own for a while, you'll realize that your mind can go on "auto pilot." This self-described auto pilot is simply the part of your ego that your brain built for driving. You know to check your surroundings periodically, you know to watch for certain signs and even before you can read their text you recognize their shape/color, you know without having to look how far you need to shift your feet to reach the break/gas, and so on.</p>
